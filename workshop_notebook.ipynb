    "> **Second**, cars are photographed from various perspectives - front, side, rear, close-ups, wide shots. A scratch viewed straight-on looks different than the same scratch at an angle.\n",

    "> **Third**, this is instance segmentation - we need to detect and segment EACH individual damage, not just classify the whole image. Much harder!\n",

    "## Cross-analyzing Complexity and Representativeness\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to identify samples that face **two challenges simultaneously**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High complexity** - Many damages to detect (harder task)\n",
    "2. **Low representativeness** - Rare/unusual scenarios (less training data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "When a model struggles on complex images, it could be for two reasons:\n",
    "- **Inherent difficulty**: More objects = harder detection task\n",
    "- **Data scarcity**: Fewer training examples = less learned patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The worst-case scenarios are images that suffer from **both** problems - they're hard to detect AND the model has seen few similar examples during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Edge Case Score\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute an **edge case score** for each sample by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardizing both metrics** (z-scores) to put them on the same scale\n",
    "2. **Combining them**: `edge_case_score = complexity_z - representativeness_z`\n",
    "\n",
    "**High scores** indicate samples that are:\n",
    "- More complex than average (high complexity_z)\n",
    "- Less representative than average (low representativeness, so subtracting it increases the score)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overall correlation**: Does complexity correlate with representativeness across the dataset? A negative correlation confirms that complex scenarios are indeed rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Per-sample scores**: Which specific images are the \"double whammy\" cases that deserve special attention for data collection or model improvement?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actionable Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prioritize data collection**: Find more examples similar to high edge-case-score samples\n",
    "2. **Explain performance gaps**: Model struggles aren't just about task difficulty - it's also data availability\n",
    "3. **Strategic evaluation**: Separate \"hard because complex\" from \"hard because rare\"\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Uniqueness tells us which images represent truly unusual scenarios - ones that don't fit into any common pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Uniqueness measures how different a sample is from all other samples in the dataset. A higher uniqueness score means the sample is less similar to others—it's an outlier or rare example.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use case:** Useful for identifying and removing near-duplicate images, or for selecting the most unique samples to bootstrap model training. Unique samples help your model learn efficiently by exposing it to the full diversity of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it's computed:** FiftyOne computes a scalar-valued `uniqueness` field for each sample, normalized to [0, 1], with 1 being the most unique sample in the dataset. This is based on the distance in embedding space to other samples—samples far from others are more unique.\n",

    "## Workshop Wrap-Up: Key Takeaways \n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we covered a complete workflow for multi-instance detection problems...\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Explore Before Training**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantify dataset complexity (objects per sample, co-occurrence patterns)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use embeddings to reveal visual structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify typical vs edge cases with representativeness metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Evaluate at Instance Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Per-object metrics, not just per-image accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand partial detection (finding some but not all objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stratify performance by scenario complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Add Semantic Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "- VLMs capture relationships between objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate searchable descriptions from visual data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bridge gaps between bounding boxes and business needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Validate Quality Systematically**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use model confidence to find annotation errors\n",
    "\n",
    "- Focus review on ambiguous object types\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distinguish model failures from labeling mistakes\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Deploy with Risk Awareness**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Auto-process high-confidence typical cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Route complex scenarios to human experts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build systems that degrade gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-instance problems require multi-dimensional thinking:**\n",
    "\n",
    " - Complexity is measurable (count objects, diversity, unusualness)\n",
    "\n",
    " - Partial success is normal (models find some objects, miss others)\n",
    "\n",
    " - Context matters (relationships between objects)\n",
    "\n",
    " - Stratification is essential (simple ≠ complex)\n",
    "\n",
    " - Instance-level evaluation required\n",
    "\n",
    " **This methodology generalizes to any multi-object detection problem.**\n",
    "\n",
